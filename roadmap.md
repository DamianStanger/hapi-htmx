# Roadmap

* ✔ Build a basic hapi server
* ✔ Use vision and handlebars to serve content
* ✔ Add htmx with a very simple demo of dynamic content
* ✔ Add a quick links element to the main page and a separate quick links page
* Use a partial for the quick links component 
* ✔ Parameterise the url so the title takes the name of the primary term
  * this will enable better SEO
* Create a simple form to allow changing of the search terms on the page

* ✔ Add a site map with all the locations listed
